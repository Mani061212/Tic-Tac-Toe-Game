    * Clone the repository (or create a new Vite project):

    * If you're starting from scratch:
    
     - npm create vite@latest tic-tac-toe-game -- --template react

     - npx tailwindcss init -p

    * Configure Tailwind CSS:

    - Open tailwind.config.js and ensure the content array includes your React files:

      /** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
      export default {
       content: [
        "./index.html",
        "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}", // Make sure this line is present
       ],
       theme: {
       extend: {},
      },
      plugins: [],
      }

    * Add Tailwind Directives to CSS:

     - Open src/index.css (or src/App.css if you prefer) and add the following at the very top:
     
       @tailwind base;
       @tailwind components;
       @tailwind utilities;
